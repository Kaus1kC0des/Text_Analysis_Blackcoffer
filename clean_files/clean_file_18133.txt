COVID-19 reminder health planet linked health humans. Evidence proves virus zoonotic, meaning transmitted people animals. accountable seventy-five percent emerging infectious diseases World. Virus infecting millions people day globe, governments agencies’ top priority regulate spread virus shifting spotlight management treatment wastes (especially clinical medical waste). Likewise, time, responsible individuals step follow guideline precautions disposal waste medical gears. Spite data showing pollutions reduced significantly pandemic, History witnessed rise pollution “post-financial crisis”. similar case observed 2008 financial crash – temporary decrease emissions 1.3% observed, economy recovered 2010, emissions all-time high. all, sheer mutual empathy goodwill world emerge stronger global pandemic. prevent future outbreaks, address regularly threats ecosystems wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, climate change human life depends Earth’s life. live spacious outdoor area, desert empty road lined trees realize it’s safe, surface-less space walk in, begin realize beauty nature. point remain indoors, avoid close contact others. leave home, walk desert run street, make wipe surfaces contact with, avoid touching face, frequently wash hands.
