AI precision medicine precision medicine focuses healthcare interventions individuals groups patients based profile, AI devices pave practice efficiently. ML, complex algorithms large datasets predict create optimal treatment strategy. Deep learning neural networks process data healthcare apps close watch patient’s emotional state, food intake, health monitoring. “Omics” refers collective technologies exploring roles, relationships branches ending suffix “omics” genomics, proteomics, etc. Omics-based tests based machine learning algorithms find correlations predict treatment responses, ultimately creating personalized treatments individual patients. helps psychology neuro patients psychologists studying creativity, AI promising classes experiments developing data structures programs exploring theories horizon. Studies show AI conduct therapy sessions, e-therapy sessions, assessments autonomously, assisting human practitioners before, during, sessions. Detection Computational Analysis Psychological Signal project ML, computer vision, NLP analyze language, physical gestures, social signals identify cues human distress. ground-breaking technology assesses soldiers returning combat recognizes require mental health support. future, combine data captured face-to-face interviews information sleeping, eating, online behaviours complete patient view. Stroke identification Stroke frequently occurring disease affects 500 million people worldwide. Thrombus, vessel cerebral infarction major (about 85%) stroke occurrence. recent years, AI techniques numerous stroke-related studies early detection timely treatment efficient outcome prediction solve problem. AI disposal, large amounts data rich information, complications real-life clinical questions addressed arena. Currently, ML algorithms- genetic fuzzy finite state machine PCA implemented build model building solution. include human activity recognition stage stroke onset detection stage. alert stroke message activated movement significantly normal pattern recorded. ML methods applied neuroimaging data assist disease evaluation predicting stroke treatment diagnosis. Patient Monitoring Today, market AI-based patient monitoring impressive monetarily enticing. evolving artificial sensors, smart technologies explores brain-computer interfaces nanorobotics. Companies smart-watches engaged people perform remote monitoring “patients”. obvious place start wearable embedded sensors, glucose monitors, pulse monitors, oximeters, ECG monitors. patient monitoring crucial, AI finds numerous applications chronic conditions, intensive care units, operating rooms, emergency rooms, cardiac wards timeless clinical decision-making measured seconds. advances started gain traction smart prosthetics implants. play impeccable role patient management post-surgery rehabilitation. Demographics, laboratory results vital signs predict cardiac arrest, transfer intensive care unit, death. addition, interpretable machine-learning model assist anesthesiologists predicting hypoxaemia events surgery. suggests deep-learning algorithms, raw patient-monitoring data avoid information overload alert overload enabling accurate clinical prediction timely decision-making. Conclusion vast range tasks AI do, evident holds deep potential improving patient outcomes skyrocketing levels. sophisticated algorithms AI bring revolution healthcare sector. facing challenges technology deliver promises, ethical measures, training physicians it, standard regulations etc, role AI transforming clinical practices ignored. biggest challenge integration AI daily practice. overcome period technologies mature making system enhanced effective.
