“Machine intelligence invention humanity make” Nick Bostrom put frankly, Artificial Intelligence eventually replace jobs. Workers variety industries, healthcare agriculture manufacturing, expect witness hiring disruptions result Artificial Intelligence. history taught anything, disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas make fortune innovators, build groundwork business models, market entrants, job opportunities inevitably follow. true robots today future eventually replace humans jobs, innovative farming equipment humans horses industrial revolution. jobs humans end here. We, hand, required generate provide ways business models result changes. 71% businesses worldwide, Artificial Intelligence people overcome critical challenging problems live lives. Artificial Intelligence consultants work equally fair, whopping 83% corporate leaders. results demonstrate Artificial Intelligence steadily extending measures, yielding societal benefits allowing citizens live fulfilling lives. Increase Automation Jobs humans can’t compete advent Industry 4.0, businesses moving fast pace automation, type industry. 2013, researchers oxford university study future work. concluded jobs high risk automated machines. Machine learning responsible disruption. powerful branch artificial intelligence. machines learn data mimic things humans do. research conducted employees Kaggle algorithm created images human eye diagnose eye disease diabetic retinopathy. Here, winning algorithm match diagnosis human ophthalmologists. study conducted algorithm created grade high school essays. too, winning algorithm match grade human teachers. Thus, safely conclude data, machines easily outperform human beings tasks these. teacher read 10,000 essays 40-year career; ophthalmologist 50,000 eyes machine read million essays million eyes minutes. Thus, convenient conclude chance competing machines frequent, high volume tasks. Tasks machines don’t work tasks human beings upper hand, is, tasks. Machines can’t handle things haven’t times before. fundamental rule machine learning learns large volumes past data. humans don’t; ability seemingly connecting disparate threads solve problems haven’t before. Percy Spencer physicist working radar world war 2 noticed magnetron melting chocolate bar. Here, connect understanding electromagnetic radiation knowledge cooking order invent microwave oven. sort cross pollination times day. Thus, machines compete tackling situations. 92% talented professionals soft skills human interactions fostering relationships matter hard skills successful managing workplace. Perhaps, kind tasks machines compete humans at. Also, creative tasks: copy marketing campaign grab customers’ attention stand crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps market working them. machines outperform humans tasks, humans creating campaigns strategies. Human contact essential care-giving educational-related work responsibilities, technology backseat. Health screenings customer service face-to-face communication advocate human contact, Artificial Intelligence playing supporting role. So, future work? future state single job lies answer single question: extent job reducible tackling frequent high-volume tasks extent involve tackling situations? Today machines diagnose diseases grade exam papers, coming years they’re conduct audits, they’re read boilerplate legal contracts. we’re needing accountants lawyers? Wrong. We’re complex tax structuring, path breaking litigation. tougher jobs machine learning shrink ranks. Amazon recruited 100,000 robots warehouses move goods products effectively, warehouse workforce expanded 80,000 people. Humans pick pack goods (Amazon 480,000,000 products “shelves”), robots move orders enormous warehouses, reducing “the amount walking required workers, making Amazon pickers efficient exhausted.” Furthermore, Amazon longer requires aisle space humans, robots enable Amazon pack shelves cars rush-hour traffic.” inventory roof offers selection customers, higher density shelf space equals inventory roof. Kodak Instagram Kodak, undisputed giant photography industry, 90% share USA market 1976, 1984, employing 1,45,000 people. year 2012, net worth negative $1 billion declare bankruptcy. Why? failed predict importance exponential trends technology. hand, Instagram, digital photography company started 2012 13 employees sold Facebook $1 billion. ironic Kodak pioneered digital photography invented digital camera thought mere product didn’t pay attention created problem. live era artificial intelligence (AI), tremendous computing power, storage space, information access. spinning wheel first, electricity second, computers industrial revolution exponential growth technology. Airbnb breakthrough idea! Airbnb, giant start-up enabling homeowners rent homes couches travellers, example, “is creating Artificial Intelligence system empower designers product engineers literally ideas drawing board convert actual products instantly.” significant breakthrough you’re designer, engineer, type technologist. Differences Automation brings table: key automation bring macro level: capability demandGender imbalance workforce redeploymentFirm reorganization. Sectors trouble Artificial Intelligence isn’t fad. Tractica, market research firm, published report 2016 predicted “annual global revenue artificial intelligence products services expand 643.7 million 2016 $36.8 billion 2025, 57-fold increase time span.” result, industry’s fastest-growing segment size.” reduction people result Artificial Intelligence related technologies, resulted job layoffs, fear. India alone, job losses sector reportedly reached 1,000 year, owing integration advanced technologies artificial intelligence machine learning. companies Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Cognizant reduced employee base India recruiting less, engaging personnel United States investing heavily “centres innovation.” Artificial Intelligence data science, trending aspects require fewer people primarily located abroad, aren’t helping prospects local employees. factor computer industry continuously growing develop size million workers. Unfortunately, it’s drop bucket compared robots Information Technology’s less-skilled brothers. Large e-commerce sites operated armies people manned 200 robots produced GreyOrange, Indian company based Gurgaon. indefatigable robots lift stack boxes 24 hours day, 30-minute break recharging, cut employees 80%. efficiency, victory disaster job prospects. Concluding remarks Internal re-skilling redeployment staff critical requirement hour. Artificial intelligence presented Indian policymakers epistemological, scientific, ethical issues. requires abandon regular, linear, non-disruptive mental patterns. tale artificial intelligence’s influence individuals occupations told time. upskill ways stay current industry’s current trends demands. So, machines jobs? answer resounding yes. However, job robots, equal number positions people do. human vocations artistic nature. necessitate humans honing superhuman cognitive abilities. Humans machines form symbiotic relationships, assisting best. future, people machines collaborate work common goal business work for.
