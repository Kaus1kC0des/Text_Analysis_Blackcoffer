AI made major strides replicating efficacy human intelligence executing tasks, major limitations. particular, AI programs typically capable “specialized” intelligence, meaning solve problem, execute task time. Often, rigid, unable respond input, perform “thinking” prescribed programming. Humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” kind problem-solving, abstract thinking, critical judgment continue important business. Human judgment relevant, task, level sectors. factors limit runaway advancement AI. AI requires “learning” involve massive amounts data, calling question availability kind data, highlighting categorization issues privacy security data. limitation computation processing power. cost electricity power supercharged language model AI estimated $4.6 million. important limitation note data carry bias, reflective societal inequities implicit biases designers create input data. bias data inputted AI, bias carry results generated AI. bill introduced Congress entitled Algorithmic Accountability Act goal forcing Federal Trade Commission investigate AI technology potential perpetuate bias. Based factors others, MIT CCI paper argues long reaching point AI comparable human intelligence, theoretically replace human workers entirely. Provided investment levels, education private sector governmental organizations—anywhere focuses training upskilling workers—AI potential ultimately create jobs, less. question “humans computers” “humans computers” involved complex systems advance industry prosperity. paper fascinating read hoping dive deeper AI potential directions lead.AI standard businesses, world tech couple times recently, AI conversation client associate, I’m noticing fallacy people thinking it. sense phenomenon big impacts tech world. case hadn’t noticed, tech world world days.
