COVID-19 halted facing nth wave coronavirus outbreak countries, notably US, India, Brazil. fact Data Analytics AI big guns artillery fight COVID-19 pandemic. helped stages outbreak, detection outbreak, vaccine development manufacturing contact tracing, future hotspot detection. interesting applications discussed article. lesser-known fact COVID-19 outbreak detected Toronto, Canada, 7,230 miles outbreak, days issued warning. Big Data Analytics AI, specifically Deep Learnings (DL, subset Machine Learning) application Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyze text inputs traced surge pneumonia cases Wuhan province China. specialty DL algorithms mimic brain cells called neurons identify patterns Big Data. DL-backed software inputs, reports public health organizations, global airline ticketing data, etc. flag unusual surges potential spreads infectious diseases. application Big Data Analytics AI Research Development drugs halt COVID-19. AI analyze protein structure virus, findings significant progress vaccine development. preliminary studies, found mutate fast viruses HIV, means prophylactic vaccine proceed therapy. evidence supporting fact find kind cure it, chance virus mutating, happened major mutations found UK, Brazil, South Africa. AI assisted scientists rapidly shortlisting set vaccines effective coronavirus. interesting application AI found selection candidates, i.e. test positive testing coronavirus case insufficient testing resources. method exercised Greek borders called project EVA. traveler wanted Greece, fill form Passenger Locator Form (PLF) 24 hours prior arrival, information origin country, demographics, point, date entry, intended destination. EVA allocated testing resources size set passengers tested. test results, found positive, put quarantine. results back program real-time learning. question remains EVA made allocations, found that, statistically, origin country city significant factors screening. Ultimately, variety countries city pairs, EVA predict testing resources allocated entry point passengers location technically called Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, chosen method solve problem AI algorithm called optimistic Gittins index. algorithm identified average 1.85x asymptomatic, infected travelers random surveillance testing, 2-4x peak travel. test results, found positive, put quarantine. collection significant data aforementioned process, period, policies made categorizing separately imposing restrictions travelers specific location. EVA presented operation August 6th November 1st processing 38,500 PLFs day testing average 18.5% households entering country day. mentioned applications show tip iceberg developments watch include Image Recognition identify covid based x-ray images, Deep Learning predict 3-D protein structure COVID-19 on.
