talk AI, people perspectives it. group people, good knowledge real potential AI, AI solution problems world facing today. group people threatened thought AI taking world. field AI birth Alan Turing 1950 thought “Can machines think?”. 1980s, adoption “expert systems” companies world, booming field AI initiated. Initially, matter awe results AI achieve. AI’s growth past decades exponential transformed live, work solve challenges. AI made impact wide variety areas including healthcare, education, business more. But, areas highest impact AI made recently environment climate change. AI Revolutionizing deal Environment Climate Change? AI strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making decarbonising industries building transport, work allocate renewable energy. recent years, AI game-changer people, organizations, deal climate change. Microsoft believes artificial intelligence, encompassing machine learning deep learning, “game-changer” climate change environmental issues. company’s ‘AI Earth’ program committed $50 million years create test applications AI. AI increasingly manage intermittency renewable energy incorporated grid; handle power fluctuations improve energy storage well. Wind companies AI turbine’s propeller produce electricity rotation incorporating real-time weather operational data. AI improve energy efficiency city scale incorporating data smart meters Internet Things (the internet computing devices embedded everyday objects, enabling send receive data) forecast energy demand. Besides, artificial intelligence systems simulate potential zoning laws, building ordinances, flood plains urban planning disaster preparedness. vision sustainable city create “urban dashboard” consisting real-time data energy water availability, traffic weather make cities energy-efficient livable. Hotter temperatures significant impacts agriculture well. Data sensors field monitor crop moisture, soil composition temperature AI improve production crops watering. Incorporating information drones, monitor conditions, increasingly automatic AI systems times plant, spray harvest crops, head diseases problems. result increased efficiency, enhanced yields, lower water, fertilizer pesticides. But, AI good downside? talk effect AI environment climate, sides coin elucidated. So, positives discussed above, usage AI downside. year’s World Economic Forum report showed AI address Earth’s environmental challenges, important manage properly. forum experts field, AI potential accelerate environmental degradation. power-intensive GPUs run machine learning training cited contributing increased C02 emissions. AI half century, question environmental impact – ethical issues – arising techniques developed decades combination explosion data strong computational power. advances enabled artificial intelligence, speech recognition self-driving cars, AI systems consume lot power generate high volumes climate-changing carbon emissions. study year found training off-the-shelf AI language-processing system produced 1,400 pounds emissions – amount produced flying person roundtrip York San Francisco. ways make machine learning cleaner greener, movement called “Green AI.” algorithms power-hungry others, example, training sessions moved remote locations power renewable sources. key, however, AI developers companies machine learning experiments spewing volumes reduced. done? prevent this, proposition World Economic Forum report advancements “safe” AI pursued, ensure humanity developing AI harmful environment. Specifically, World Economic Forum report AI developers “must incorporate health natural environment fundamental dimension.” means safeguarding models demand consumption energy natural resources sustainable, factors. sense, programs designed dimension environmental protection improvement mind. future development AI programs, important note environmental impact creating systems place. academic study energy usage deep learning processes, creation effective AI costly environment. 300,000 kilograms carbon dioxide equivalent emissions created process training single model. basically equal emissions average cars United States. negative environmental impact addition positive implications AI climate change crucial, moving forward. room improvement, pioneers machine learning recently published paper called Tackling Climate Change Machine Learning discussed major AI conference. David Rolnick, postdoctoral fellow University Pennsylvania “call arms” means bring researchers together. paper covers thirteen areas research machine learning used, including energy production, CO2 removal, education, solar geoengineering, finance more. main idea build energy-efficient buildings, creating low-carbon materials, high tech monitoring deforestation greener transportation sources. Artificial intelligence machine learning medium real work caretaker mother earth. forecasting climate change? kick start climate informatics 2011 regulates collaboration data science climate science. covers wide range topics improving prediction extreme events hurricanes, paleoclimatology, collecting data ice cores, climate up-down scaling impact us. “There’s lot uncertainty,” Monteleoni Claire Monteleoni, computer science professor University Colorado concludes AI/ ML models generally forecast short-term. significant difference long-term forecasting. system developed Princeton 1960s. AI/ ML models developed till revolve atmosphere, oceans, land, cryosphere ice. AI achieve heights amount data collected point time, compute complex climate conditions climate modeling algorithms. showing effects extreme weather? climate change real rise atmospheric temperature proof, make realistic, Montreal Institute Learning Algorithms (MILA), Microsoft ConscientAI Labs Generative Adversarial Networks popularly GANs simulate mother earth rising sea levels, atmospheric temperature, air pollution intensive storms. “Our goal convince people climate change real, it’s people real that,” Victor Schmidt, co-author paper Ph.D. candidate MILA project deployed people places future significant climate change. track carbon emissions? Short answer, yes. Tracking carbon emission agendas UN. year 2020, UN’s goal prevent coal plants built. Satellite images picture deep learning techniques, data science researchers analyze high quality satellite images track emission. Google expanding horizon nonprofit’s satellite imagery, including gas-powered plants emissions researchers track pollution. countries organizations govern CO2 emission ground level data unreachable global monitoring associations. AI automate analysis images power plants regular updates emissions. introduces ways measure plant’s impact, crunching numbers nearby infrastructure electricity use. That’s beneficial gas-powered plants don’t easy-to-measure plumes coal-powered plants have.
